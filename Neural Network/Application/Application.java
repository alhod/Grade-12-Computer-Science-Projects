// Name: Andrew Deng
// Date: January 19, 2024
// Course Code: ICS4U1
// Title: Digit Classifier
// Description: Allows user to draw a digit. Image is converted into numerical 
// values represented as a matrix, then passed into a neural network trained on 
// recognizing hand written digits, which attempts to classify the digit between 
// 0 and 9.
// Features:
// - No machine-learning related external libraries: Neural network, neural network 
// layers, and the training and serialization processes were all made from scratch. 
// All the math and matrix operations were coded from scratch, and require no use of 
// external libraries.
// - Drawing feature: User is able to draw an image.
// - Classification feature: Image is classified into digit between 0 and 9.
// - Display neural network perspective feature: Displays how the neural network sees the image.
// - Display confidence feature: Displays the probability output of the neural network model.
// - Model selection feature: User is able to select from different models to test out.
// Major skills:
// - Modular programming
// - OOP
// - Use of external libraries (only for convenience for model serialization into JSON)
// - Data structures: ArrayList, 2D ArrayList, String, int, double
// - Iteration
// Areas of Concern:
// - Machine learning model is not very accurate.
// - User doesn't see much of what's happening in the backend math-wise.
