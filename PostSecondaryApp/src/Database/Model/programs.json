The Engineering Pathway provides qualifying students access to a first year of study at Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie, followed by a seamless transition to the second year of Engineering at Laurentian University in Sudbury in either Mechanical, Chemical or Mining Engineering.Reactions, interactions and creation – the science and study behind the building blocks of life. Chemical Engineering students learn about organic and inorganic chemistry, statistics and chemical processes and reactions. They use creativity to solve issues related to process, design, to innovate products, research and manufacturing. Chemical Engineers work in a wide variety of roles such as civil service, process engineering, entrepreneurship, management, manufacturing, research and development, or move on to pursue graduate studies.",

This will create a unique undergraduate program that is focused on training empathetic professionals and engaged citizens.In this program, just over half of the content will be offered by the Faculty of Health Sciences; just over one-third by the Faculty of Humanities; and the remaining one-sixth from other university courses to fulfill the learning outcomes of the program. With this structure, students in the BHSc (Integrated Rehabilitation and Humanities) will encounter strong experiential learning components, options for clinical research and opportunities to participate in community engagement.",
